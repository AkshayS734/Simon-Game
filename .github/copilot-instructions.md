# Simon Game React Project Instructions

This is a React.js implementation of the classic Simon Game - a memory game where players need to remember and reproduce sequences of colored buttons.

## Project Guidelines:
- Use React functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Follow modern React best practices
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling
- Handle audio playback properly with error handling
- Implement proper game state management
- Use TypeScript for better type safety when possible
- Follow accessibility guidelines (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use semantic HTML elements

## Game Features to Implement:
- Color sequence generation and playback
- User input validation
- Level progression
- Score tracking
- High score persistence (localStorage)
- Sound effects for each color and game events
- Visual feedback for button presses
- Game over and restart functionality
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Code Style:
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibilities
- Use custom hooks for game logic
- Implement proper prop types or TypeScript interfaces
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
